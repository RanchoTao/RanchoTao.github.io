 :smiley: I am a PhD student with the [Department of Statistics and Applied Probability](https://www.pstat.ucsb.edu/){:target="\_blank"} and the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.ucsb.edu/){:target="\_blank"} at UC, Santa Barbara in the Statistical Machine Learning group, advised by [Dr. Yu-Xiang Wang](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~yuxiangw/){:target="\_blank"}. I am also co-advised by [Dr. J.S. Rao](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~xinan/index_en.html){:target="\_blank"}. I am currently pursuing PhDs in both Departments.  

I am fond of the broad area of statistical machine learning, e.g. reinforcement learning, optimization and statistics. My current research primarily focuses on building statistical foundations for offline reinforcement learning. I enjoy understanding the theoretical ground of different algorithms that are of practical importance.

Prior to coming to UCSB, I got my B.S. from [Applied Math at 
University of Science and Technology of China](http://math.ustc.edu.cn/ENGLISH/list.htm){:target="\_blank"}, where I worked with [Dr. Lijun Bo](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~lijunbo/){:target="\_blank"} and [Dr. Xinan Ma](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~xinan/Publications_en.html){:target="\_blank"}.

The primary goal of the webpage is to share my thoughts and summarize the ideas of my research and some topics I am interested in. Please check the `blog` page! For the list of papers, go to [publications](/publications) page.
