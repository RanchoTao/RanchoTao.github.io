Hi! I am a second-year student at [Beijing Institute of Mathematical Sciences and Applications (BIMSA)](https://www.bimsa.cn/)

I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence. I am extremely grateful to [**Prof. Rongling Wu**](https://www.bimsa.cn/zh-CN/detail/ronglingwu.html)，who introduced me to the world of learning theory!

My recent research focuses on the intersection of Natural Language Processing and Quantitative Trading, Specifically, I focus on solving economic problems through natural language models and quantitative models. Concurrently, I maintain a broad interest in topics related to learning theory, such as the multi-armed bandit problem, online learning, reinforcement learning theory, and deep learning theory.
